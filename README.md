# Dev Zero

## Hi Devs :facepunch:

My name is Jonas and I love programming and its way of dealing with the world's problems and abstracting from programs that help other people's lives.
I am currently learning to program to become a full stack :rocket: .

<br /> :mortar_board: &nbsp; I am currently committed to learning more about FrontEnd with React
<br /> :muscle: &nbsp; I can help you with javascript, css and html
<br /> :octocat: &nbsp; My stack: Node.js: and React.js 
<br />:speech_balloon:  &nbsp; about me: I love to program :computer:, to play :video_game: and listen to music :headphones:
